 * This stylesheet can be imported to any dumb components under /components
 * Remarks: It's suggested those Smart components under /containers not to apply their own style

 * It's required css-loader in webpack.config.js, and it's already included in package.json.
 * You can also use your own loader by modifying the setting in webpack.config.js
